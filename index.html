          >Merida is the capital and largest city in the Mexican state of
          Yucatan. Merida is located approximately 22 miles from the Gulf of
          Mexico and is considered a cultural and financial capital of the
          region. Merida is a modern city with museums, art galleries,
          restaurants, shops and boutiques. The city of Merida is the crossroads
          of the region and a great place to start your experience of the Mayan

        <h3>A brief history of Mérida</h3>
        <span>
          Merida was founded in 1542 and was named after the town of Merida in
          Extremadura Spain. The city was built on the site of the Maya city of
          "Tho." Tho had been a center of Mayan culture for centuries and
          because of this, some historians consider Merida the oldest
          continually occupied city in the Americas. Carved Maya stones from the
          ancient Tho were widely used to build the Spanish colonial buildings
          in Merida that are visibly everywhere. Late in the 19th century and
          early 20th century the area surrounding Merida prospered from the
          production of agave (known at the time as "henequen"). For a brief
          period, at the turn of the 20th century Merida was said to have housed
          more millionaires than any other city in the world. The results of
          this concentration of wealth can still be seen today.
          <br /><br />
          There are many large and elaborate homes still line the main avenue
          but only a few of these are still occupied by families. Myriad is
          known to have one of the largest historic district in the Americas.
          Colonial homes line the streets, the historical city center of Merida
          is undergoing many renovations with people moving into these old
          buildings and restoring them to their former glory.</span
